# Py5e
A python module to provide the functionality of a D&amp;D 5e engine.

This project aims to create objects and methods that can be use for computation of the rules of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition.
For example performing a saving throw against a spell for a character, or rolling initiative for a group of monsters or anything else possible within the rules of 5e.
This project aims to create a module that is then built upon by other projects, for example a chat bot could be built upon Py5e to allow people to conduct D&D sessions over that chat service or a webapp could be built ontop of Py5e to produce a service similar to sites such as roll20.
However this project only aims to provide a recreation of game mechanics that then allow people to make their own content in accordance with the D&D 5e SRD: http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd
It does not aim to distribute content published by WotC. As such this is not a "spell reference project" or a digital monster manual.
Instead it aims to provide the tools for users to create their *own* spells and monsters using the SRD freely available mechanics by providing a programmed implementation of those mechanics.
